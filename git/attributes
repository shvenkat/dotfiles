# NOTE: Setting the text attribute (text or text=auto) globally (in this file)
# can be annoying when working with upstream repos with CRLF line endings. In
# this case, just cloning the repo and checking out the default branch can mark
# CRLF files as "changed" because git tries to "normalize" line endings to LF.
# This is prevent switching branches and other headaches.

# Setting the text attribute causes git to normalize CRLF line endings to LF in
# tracked files on checkin or checkout.

# *.py    text diff=python
